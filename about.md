Welcome! This is where I'll be essentially teaching about what things I learn in regards to computers in general, linux, scripting, and the internet. The idea is that I push myself to learn enough about things to be able to actually help others understand them as well. I believe that teaching is a big force behind learning. Honestly though I think nobody but myself will read it :-)
