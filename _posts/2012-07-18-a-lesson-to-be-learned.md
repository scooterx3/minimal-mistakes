So, we were wandering around in a local thrift store (I think a lot of cool projects start out that way) when my geek-sense went off saying there was some cool gadget hidden on a shelf that my son and I were staring at while waiting for my wife to find whatever it was she was looking for. I came across a palmOne keyboard. Remember palm pilots? I have two broken ones that I've meant to "fix" but they're both toast. The reason I picked it up was because I saw it had an IR transmitter on it, and since I'd been wanting to do some IR stuff anyway to learn how it works, I thought I'd get it and 'decode' it to be able to provide input to an arduino for whatever in the heck I feel like. Not sure exactly what I'm going to do yet, but I'm excited to get started. Now I just have to order some IR receivers. Speaking of which, I was poking around at sparkfun looking at an <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8554">IR Receiver</a> when I came across a <a href="http://scooterx3.net/pdf/irPDF.pdf">PDF in the comments</a> that I thought might help me later, so I'll throw it down. Also the site http://tinkerish.com looks like it's got loads of good stuff there.


Woohoo! Check this out. Good resources that I came across over at http://hackaday.com: http://www.yourwarrantyisvoid.com/2012/07/10/hardware-remote-control-your-arduino/
